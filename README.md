New User Dashboard 

Overview
The New User Dashboard is a sleek, intuitive, and unnecessarily over-engineered UI for users who just want to check their stats, feel seen, and maybe change a password every now and then. This project exists because someone said, "We need a dashboard," and nobody asked questions.

🎯 Features
🔐 Secure(ish) login
🧍 Personalized user greeting (Hi, [insert name we definitely spelled right])
📊 Dashboard metrics nobody really understands
🎨 Dark mode toggle for ✨aesthetic✨ reasons
🛠️ Settings panel with buttons that may or may not work
🧪 Built with 12% actual code, 88% Google searches
📦 Tech Stack
React (because it's 2025 and we’re not animals)
Tailwind CSS (because we hate writing CSS)
Redux (even though we only needed useState)
Firebase (for auth, because why not)
Chart.js (to make data look cool)
